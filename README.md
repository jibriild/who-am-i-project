# who-am-i-project

My name is Jibriil. I go to Queen Elizabeth High School. I am in the 10th grade . I am feeling good right now. I don't know why but i have to write 50 words and i don't know what to say so i'll talk about myself a little longer.

My dream job is to be an engineer. Specifically civil engineering
